## v1.3.2 (2024-04-30)

### What's Changed

- Suspend certain activity when update underway, including comms and hoâ€¦ by [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) in [#153](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/153)
- Time-to-close and further memory improvements by [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) in [#145](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/145)
- Include md5 in upload by [@donavanbecker](https://github.com/donavanbecker) in [#163](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/163)
Fixes #60 Warning is now configurable in the setting page. User can set the duration of the delay before close. Lights will flash, but no beep. Controlling the beep is not yet possible.

Fixes [#150](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/150) Allow user to set the WiFi transmit power. This combined with the ability to force 802.11g should fix [#77](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/177)

Added lots of additional error checking and safeguards to address [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/151) Note, you won't see the benefits of these changes until the next update.

- More stability enhancements. Memory improvements to free up additional heap.
- Store serial log to flash on crash
- Allow logging over the network to the javascript console. No longer need a USB cable to capture the logs
Many thanks to [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) for all the work on this release.

## v1.2.1 (2024-04-04)

### What's Changed

Hk update and ota fix by [@jgstroud](https://github.com/jgstroud) in #152
### Hotfix release

- Fixed incorrect reporting of garage door state
- A number of users have reported failed OTA updates requiring a USB reflash in [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/151)
  I believe this was introduced by: [ee38a90](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/commit/ee38a9048e339e88cef1df21138e34102e10bdae)
  
  Reverted those changes
  
  NOTE: since the OTA update failure is a result of the running code and not the incoming code, you may have to flash this release with a USB cable as well, but hopefully this will fix any future OTAs.

## v0.10.0 (2024-01-27)

### What's Changed

The main reason for this release is to make the motion sensor service visible to only those that have one. After installing this release, you may have to re-pair your device to HK. If you have a motion detector, it won't show up initially, but should show up shortly after triggering it for the first time. From this point on, it will always be visible even after upgrades.
