* Sec+ 1.0 doors with "0x37" digital wall panel (e.g. 389LM) not working.
* Possible crash when a storm of HomeKit messages arrives... which may be triggered on a upgrade to Apple iOS 26 / tvOS 26 / etc.  System recovers.

## v2.0.3 (2025-09-21)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix: Issue #291 Watchdog timeout trying to retrieve timezone info

## v2.0.2 (2025-09-20)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix... Date and time on web page now displayed in the time zone of the server (NTP server feature must be enabled).
* Bugfix... Crash log display was not showing stack dump, now fixed.
* New Feature... last door open and close date and time is displayed under opening/closing status (NTP server feature must be enabled).

### Known Issues

* Sec+ 1.0 doors with digital wall panel (e.g. 889LM) sometimes do not close after a time-to-close delay. Please watch your door to make sure it closes after TTC delay.
* Possible crash when a storm of HomeKit messages arrives... which may be triggered on a upgrade to Apple iOS 26 / tvOS 26 / etc.  System recovers.

## v2.0.1 (2025-09-14)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix... Updating the ratgdo32 version from GitHub was not finding the firmware download file.
* Other... Add release notes to firmware update dialog.
* Other... Reduce unnecessary network traffic during firmware update

## v2.0.0 (2025-09-13)

**Version 2.0.0 is a major upgrade** for ESP8266-based ratgdo boards.  Almost all source files for the ESP8266 and ESP32 versions of ratgdo have been merged which results in significant changes to the underlying code base, features and function for ESP8266 versions.

While source files have been merged there remain significant differences between the two board types, most notably in the library used to communicate with HomeKit which are completely different.

* Before an Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade it is good to first reboot your current version.

### What's Changed

* New feature... Door open & close duration reported on ratgdo web page
* New feature... Door cycle count reported on ratgdo web page (Sec+2.0 doors only)
* Bugfix... Expected impovement in overall performance, stability and reliability
* Other... Significant source code changes to support move towards single code base for ESP8266 and ESP32
* Other... Updates to Sec+ 1.0 door control to improve reliability.  With thanks to @mitchjs

### Known Issues

* If you upgrade to v2.0.0 and then later downgrade back to v1.9.1 or earlier, then Static IP address settings will be lost.

## v1.9.1 (2025-08-21)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix... Handle invalid packets on Sec+1.0 doors that was incorrectly causing door state change to be reported. With thanks to @mitchjs
* Bugfix... Make sure that a previous WiFi packet has finished sending before attempting to send another, fixes occasional crashes we were seeing.
* Other... Strategically add esp_yield() around HomeKit crypto functions to protect against WatchDog timeouts.

### Known Issues

* None

## v1.9.0 (2025-07-18)

## v1.6.0 (2024-06-17)

### What's Changed

* Documentation updates and test HomeKit server running by @dkerr64 in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/197>

**NOTE: You will need to re-pair with HomeKit after installing this update.**
The most reliable way to do this is 1) erase from Apple Home, 2) reset/re-pair button on ratgdo, 3) kill Apple Home and restart it and 4) scan the QR code.

## v1.4.0 (2024-05-30)

## v1.3.2 (2024-04-30)

### What's Changed

* Suspend certain activity when update underway, including comms and ho… by [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) in [#153](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/153)
* Time-to-close and further memory improvements by [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) in [#145](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/145)

Fixes #60 Warning is now configurable in the setting page. User can set the duration of the delay before close. Lights will flash, but no beep. Controlling the beep is not yet possible.

Fixes [#150](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/150) Allow user to set the WiFi transmit power. This combined with the ability to force 802.11g should fix [#77](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/177)

Added lots of additional error checking and safeguards to address [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/151) Note, you won't see the benefits of these changes until the next update.

* More stability enhancements. Memory improvements to free up additional heap.
* Store serial log to flash on crash
* Allow logging over the network to the javascript console. No longer need a USB cable to capture the logs
Many thanks to [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) for all the work on this release.

Full Changelog: [v1.2.1...v1.3.2](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.2)

## v1.2.1 (2024-04-04)

### What's Changed

Hk update and ota fix by [@jgstroud](https://github.com/jgstroud) in #152

### Hotfix release

* Fixed incorrect reporting of garage door state
* A number of users have reported failed OTA updates requiring a USB reflash in [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/151)
  I believe this was introduced by: [ee38a90](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/commit/ee38a9048e339e88cef1df21138e34102e10bdae)
  
  Reverted those changes
  
  NOTE: since the OTA update failure is a result of the running code and not the incoming code, you may have to flash this release with a USB cable as well, but hopefully this will fix any future OTAs.

## v0.10.0 (2024-01-27)

### What's Changed

The main reason for this release is to make the motion sensor service visible to only those that have one. After installing this release, you may have to re-pair your device to HK. If you have a motion detector, it won't show up initially, but should show up shortly after triggering it for the first time. From this point on, it will always be visible even after upgrades.
