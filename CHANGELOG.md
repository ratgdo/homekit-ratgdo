* Bugfix... Possible fix to <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/215> by modifying HomeKit server malloc() from local to global.
* Bugfix... Possible fix to <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/211> and <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/223> as we enable IRAM heap.
* Bugfix... Occasional HomeKit notification that garage door is unlocked. Tracked in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/233>

### Known Issues

* Occasional failure to connect to WiFi. Tracked in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/217>

## v1.7.1 (2024-09-23)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix... alignment of minHeap and minStack was wrong on chrome browsers.
* Bugfix... set WiFi hostname based on user provided device name.
* Bugfix... also set the browser page title to the user provided device name.
* New feature... allow user to set custom username for the webpage.
* New feature... allow user to set static IP address.
* New feature... add new system logs page (opens in new browser tab).
* New feature... add spinning page-loading icon to provide feedback on slow network links
* New feature... add option to obtain real time from NTP sever
* Cleanup... consolidated all code for retrieving user configured settings into one file (utilities.cpp).

### Known Issues

* Same as v1.7.0

## v1.7.0 (2024-08-10)

### What's Changed

* Removed the heap fragmentation tracking introduced in v1.6.1... it was occasionally crashing inside Arduino library.
* Bugfix... device reboot countdown timer from 30 seconds to zero was not always displaying.
* New feature... add _reset door_ button. This resets the Sec+ 2.0 rolling code and whether the door has a motion sensor or not.
* New feature... add option to trigger motion sensor on user pressing wall panel buttons (door open/close, light and/or lock).
* New feature... add option to trigger motion sensor on door obstruction.
* New feature... add option for user to select whether the LED light remains on while device is idle or turns off.  Any activity causes the LED to flash.

### Known Issues

* Random crashes inside the MDNSresponder code which usually occur shortly after booting or when something significant changes on the network that causes a storm of mDNS messages. Ratgdo always recovers. Tracked in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/211>, <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/223>
* Random crashes inside the WiFi stack possibly associated with failing to connect to WiFi access point.  Tracked in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/215>, <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/218>, <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/223>
* Occasional failure to connect to WiFi. Tracked in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/217>

## v1.6.1 (2024-07-28)

### What's Changed

* Fixes to SEC1.0 when no DIGITAL wall panel connected by @mitchjs in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/208>
* Improve memory heap usage tracking and logging to assist with future debugging
* Cleaned up numerous compiler warnings

The only functional change in this release is to better support Sec+ 1.0 garage door openers when there is no digital wall panel.  Upgrading is therefore optional if your GDO is Sec+ 2.0.

## v1.6.0 (2024-06-17)

### What's Changed

* Documentation updates and test HomeKit server running by @dkerr64 in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/197>

Full Changelog: [v1.2.1...v1.3.2](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.2)

## v1.2.1 (2024-04-04)

### What's Changed

Hk update and ota fix by [@jgstroud](https://github.com/jgstroud) in #152

### Hotfix release

* Fixed incorrect reporting of garage door state
* A number of users have reported failed OTA updates requiring a USB reflash in [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/151)
  I believe this was introduced by: [ee38a90](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/commit/ee38a9048e339e88cef1df21138e34102e10bdae)
  
  Reverted those changes
  
  NOTE: since the OTA update failure is a result of the running code and not the incoming code, you may have to flash this release with a USB cable as well, but hopefully this will fix any future OTAs.
