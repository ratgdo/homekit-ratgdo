# Change Log

All notable changes to `homekit-ratgdo` will be documented in this file. This project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).


## v2.0.6 (2025-10-12)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix: HomeKit pairing failed with out-of-compliance error. https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/300
* Bugfix: Web wage status occasionally getting out-of-sync with actual light/lock/door state.
* Bugfix: Door open/close duration calculation not handling cases where door reverses before reaching open/close state.
* Bugfix: Setting syslog port not taking effect until after reboot. https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/304
* Feature: Change WiFi and MDNS hostname when user changes GDO name. https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo32/issues/93
* Feature: Add clipboard copy icon to IP address and mDNS name.
* Other: Detect (but do not support) 0x37 wall panels like LiftMaster 398LM. https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo32/issues/95
* Other: ESP8266 (original ratgdo) only... suspend GDO communications during HomeKit pairing process.
* Other: ESP8266 (original ratgdo) only... move more constants into PROGMEM and optimize use of system stack.

### Known Issues

* Sec+ 1.0 doors with digital wall panel (e.g. 889LM) sometimes do not close after a time-to-close delay. Please watch your door to make sure it closes after TTC delay.
* Sec+ 1.0 doors with "0x37" digital wall panel (e.g. 398LM) not working.  We now detect but will not support them.  Recommend replacing with 889LM panel.
* When creating automations in Apple Home the garage door may show only lock/unlock and not open/close as triggers.  This is a bug in Apple Home. Workaround is to use the Eve App to create the automation, it will show both options.

## v2.0.0 (2025-09-13)

**Version 2.0.0 is a major upgrade** for ESP8266-based ratgdo boards.  Almost all source files for the ESP8266 and ESP32 versions of ratgdo have been merged which results in significant changes to the underlying code base, features and function for ESP8266 versions.

While source files have been merged there remain significant differences between the two board types, most notably in the library used to communicate with HomeKit which are completely different.

* Before an Over-The-Air (OTA) upgrade it is good to first reboot your current version.

### What's Changed

* New feature... Door open & close duration reported on ratgdo web page
* New feature... Door cycle count reported on ratgdo web page (Sec+2.0 doors only)
* Bugfix... Expected impovement in overall performance, stability and reliability
* Other... Significant source code changes to support move towards single code base for ESP8266 and ESP32
* Other... Updates to Sec+ 1.0 door control to improve reliability.  With thanks to @mitchjs

### Known Issues

* If you upgrade to v2.0.0 and then later downgrade back to v1.9.1 or earlier, then Static IP address settings will be lost.

## v1.9.1 (2025-08-21)

### What's Changed

* Bugfix... Handle invalid packets on Sec+1.0 doors that was incorrectly causing door state change to be reported. With thanks to @mitchjs
* Bugfix... Make sure that a previous WiFi packet has finished sending before attempting to send another, fixes occasional crashes we were seeing.
* Other... Strategically add esp_yield() around HomeKit crypto functions to protect against WatchDog timeouts.

### Known Issues

* None

## v1.9.0 (2025-07-18)

## v1.7.0 (2024-08-10)

### What's Changed

* Removed the heap fragmentation tracking introduced in v1.6.1... it was occasionally crashing inside Arduino library.

### Known Issues

* Random crashes inside the MDNSresponder code which usually occur shortly after booting or when something significant changes on the network that causes a storm of mDNS messages. Ratgdo always recovers. Tracked in <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/211>, <https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/223>

## v1.6.0 (2024-06-17)

### What's Changed

**NOTE: You will need to re-pair with HomeKit after installing this update.**
The most reliable way to do this is 1) erase from Apple Home, 2) reset/re-pair button on ratgdo, 3) kill Apple Home and restart it and 4) scan the QR code.

Lots of changes mainly focuses on trying to prevent flash corruptions.

## v1.4.0 (2024-05-21)

### What's Changed

## v1.3.2 (2024-04-30)

### What's Changed

* Suspend certain activity when update underway, including comms and ho… by [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) in [#153](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/153)
* Time-to-close and further memory improvements by [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) in [#145](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/145)

Fixes #60 Warning is now configurable in the setting page. User can set the duration of the delay before close. Lights will flash, but no beep. Controlling the beep is not yet possible.

Fixes [#150](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/150) Allow user to set the WiFi transmit power. This combined with the ability to force 802.11g should fix [#77](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/177)

Added lots of additional error checking and safeguards to address [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/issues/151) Note, you won't see the benefits of these changes until the next update.

* More stability enhancements. Memory improvements to free up additional heap.
* Store serial log to flash on crash
* Allow logging over the network to the javascript console. No longer need a USB cable to capture the logs
Many thanks to [@dkerr64](https://github.com/dkerr64) for all the work on this release.

Full Changelog: [v1.2.1...v1.3.2](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.2)

## v1.2.1 (2024-04-04)

### What's Changed

Hk update and ota fix by [@jgstroud](https://github.com/jgstroud) in #152

### Hotfix release

* Fixed incorrect reporting of garage door state
* A number of users have reported failed OTA updates requiring a USB reflash in [#151](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/pull/151)
  I believe this was introduced by: [ee38a90](https://github.com/ratgdo/homekit-ratgdo/commit/ee38a9048e339e88cef1df21138e34102e10bdae)
  
  Reverted those changes
  
  NOTE: since the OTA update failure is a result of the running code and not the incoming code, you may have to flash this release with a USB cable as well, but hopefully this will fix any future OTAs.

## v0.10.0 (2024-01-27)

### What's Changed

The main reason for this release is to make the motion sensor service visible to only those that have one. After installing this release, you may have to re-pair your device to HK. If you have a motion detector, it won't show up initially, but should show up shortly after triggering it for the first time. From this point on, it will always be visible even after upgrades.
